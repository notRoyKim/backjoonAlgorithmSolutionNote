B. Server room
  server room is made of N x N cells.(1 <= N <= 100)
    there will be multiple computers on server lacks. 
    you should run air conditioner 'til half of computers run perfectly. 
    every 1 minute air conditioner produce N x N x 5(cm^3) cold air, 
    and every computer's height is 5cm. 
   
   how long air conditioner produce cold air for run over half of computers perfectly?

I. Powers that Three(Be*) 1
  Joonha feels the power when he saw the number which is only made with powers of three.
    If you could make a number only using the 3^n, then you can call it "THE POWER OF THREE".
    But, you can only use a numbers once. for example, 109 can be traslated to 1(3^0) + 3^3 + 3^4.
    So 109 is "THE POWER OF THREE", but 7 and 18 are not "THE POWER OF THREE."
    *Input data is positive integer that's smaller than 2,147,483,647.*
    
  Joonha want's to know how many numbers that make him to feel the powers.
